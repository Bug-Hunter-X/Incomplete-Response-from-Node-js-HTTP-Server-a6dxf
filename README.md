# Incomplete Response from Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Node.js HTTP servers: returning an incomplete response due to improper handling of the response object.  The server starts, but the client might not receive the complete 'Hello World!' message, leading to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.  The problem is explained in detail within the files themselves.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.  Note the server output.
4. Use a tool like `curl` or a web browser to access `http://localhost:3000`.  Observe whether the response is complete.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with `bugSolution.js` to compare the behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves careful handling of the response object's `end()` method, and ensuring all necessary headers are sent prior to data transmission. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
